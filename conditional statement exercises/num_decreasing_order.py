# Congratulations! You are one more step close to Python Programming World.
# You are now familiar with if-elif-else in Python, and for loop in Python.
#
# While loop in Python is same as like in CPP and Java, but, here you have to use ':'
# to end while statement (used to end any statement). While loop is used to iterate same as for loop,
# except that in while loop you can customize jump of steps in coupling with variable used to loop,
# after every iteration,
# unlike in for loop (you cannot customize jump according to the variable you are using to loop through).
#
# Let's get it more clearly through this question.
# Given a number x, the task is to print the numbers from x to 0 in decreasing order in a single line.
def decreaseorder():
    num = int(input("enter any number greater than 0"))
    while i>0:
        print(i)
